Scholar Calendar
================

Logs on to Virginia Tech's Scholar website and puts assignment and course data in one convenient place. Alarms get set to warn you whenever you have upcoming assignments due so nothing ever sneaks up on you again.

The app is around 80-90% finished, there are some minor things that need to be added before it can go into production, and there are always going to be more features that could be added to it to make it better.
